# Udacity-BikeShare-Project:
## Python Project on Introduction to Programming in Data Science 

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on pandas library usage and simple statistics methods to perform analysis on the bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, New York City, and Washington - to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.

### Running the program:
You can input ```python bikeshare.py``` on your terminal to run this program.

### Program Details:
The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option).

Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (5 rows of data initially) or not. Following the input received, the program prints the following details:

Most popular month

Most popular day

Most popular hour

Most popular start station

Most popular end station

Most popular combination of start and end stations

Total trip duration

Average trip duration

Types of users by number

Types of users by gender (if available)

users birth dates (if available)

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.

### Requirements:
Language: Python 3.10 or above

Libraries: pandas, numpy, time

### Reference and Project Data:
The datasets containing all bikeshare information for the three cities (Chicago, New York and Washington) were all provided by Udacity.
